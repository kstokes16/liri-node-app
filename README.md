# Liri Bot App #

The Liri Bot app uses three different APIs to help a user find a song with Spotify, discover upcoming events for a band through BandsInTown and learn more information about a movie through OMDB. 

The app was built with multiple NPM packages, and is run based off of user input in the terminal. Outside of finding a song, events or movie info, the app also works by reading text within an outside .txt file and performing that action. 

## Spotify ##

By typing 'spotify-this-song' followed by a space and 'xyz song', a user can find detailed information about a song, thanks to accessing the Spotify-web-API

## BandsInTown ##

By typing 'concert-this' followed by a space and 'band goes here', a user can see upcoming events for the artist that was keyed in. 

## OMDB ##

By typing 'movie-this' followed by a space and 'movie name here', a user can see detailed information about a movie, including its release year, actors and plot.

## Do-This ##

The 'do-this' function allows the user to type 'do-this' and have the app read what is located within an outside .txt file and perform that action.
